# Kuksa-InVehicle Repo

 ![Alt text](./logos/kuksa.png?raw=true "Eclipse kuksa logo")

[Eclipse Kuksa](https://www.eclipse.org/kuksa/) includes an open and secure cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via open in-car and Internet connection and is supported by an integrated open source software development ecosystem. The Eclipse Kuksa project conatins a set of repositories and this repo is one among those that contains in-vehicle platform code and also contains required layers and bindings to build a Kuksa adapted AGL (Automotive Grade Linux) distribution. The in-vehicle platform is primarily designed to work with AGL. However the individual components found in this repo could be used on other platforms as well.



## Projects

* *agl-kuksa* - Scripts to automate AGL build system with the meta-kuksa layers.
* *elm327-visdatafeeder* - ELM 327 app that reads OBDII data from the vehicle and feeds data to the w3c-visserver.
* *kuksa-hawkbit* - Barebone API for connecting with Hawkbit. Will be shortly replaced with kuksa-appmanager.
* *w3c-visserver-api* - W3C Vehicle Information Specification API.
* *direct-access-api* - Enables sending CAN messages from the cloud to vehicle using Websocket.
* *datalogger-http* - Example app that sends data from the vehicle to an Eclipse Hono instance with http.
* *datalogger-mqtt* - Example app that sends data from the vehicle to an Eclipse Hono instance with mqtt.
* *remoteAccess* - Example app that subscribes to control topic with Hono and receives commands sent.
* *kuksa-appmanager* - Hawkbit appmanager which deploys in-vehicle apps as docker conatiners and more..
* *email-notifier* - Example app that talks to an email-server and sends e-mails to the configured email address. Used at the moment only for internal demos.
* *app-ids* - Proof-of-Concept implementation of a modular Host-based Intrusion Detection System
