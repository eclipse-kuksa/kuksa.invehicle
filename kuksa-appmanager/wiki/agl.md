# AGL Recipe

In order to use the AppManager with the AGL recipe, the configuration file /etc/kuksa-appmanager.conf has to be modified to fill in the HawkBit (and optionally Hono) settings.

If the configuration is changed the service has to be restarted for the changes to take effect:

    # systemctl restart kuksa-appmanager
