# Kuksa Hawkbit

Kuksa's hawkbit downloader. Can query hawkbit and download new artifacts.

Current version is quite stupid: Will download everything it finds in deployment, and we do not have an installer yet, so we can not give any meaningful feedback to Hawkbit yet 

## Requirements

``sudo pip3 install requests``
